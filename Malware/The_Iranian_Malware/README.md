## MainActivity

The app prompts the user to enter a phone number, validates it, requests permission to receive SMS messages, and, if validated, stores it in SharedPreferences.
After storing the phone number, it calls a connect method with some parameters (potentially to initialize a connection or process).
Finally, if all steps are successful, the app starts MainActivity2.
