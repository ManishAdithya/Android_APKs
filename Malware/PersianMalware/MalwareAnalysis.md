Lets first analyse the activites and services present in the app using JADX. 

We see multiple activites and service and few stand very suspicious :

Let's have a look at the permissions requested by the app in the Manifest file:

This app requests an unusually large number of permissions, many of which are highly invasive and typical of spyware, banking trojans, or surveillance malware.

1) The above permissions are very common in malwares to do the listed actions. 

2) Also there are below permissions which if may lead to potential frauds :

Now let's breakdown the MainActivity :

```
private boolean areAllPermissionsGranted() {
        return fj.a(this, "android.permission.READ_CONTACTS") == 0 && fj.a(this, "android.permission.CALL_PHONE") == 0 && fj.a(this, "android.permission.READ_SMS") == 0 && fj.a(this, "android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS") == 0 && fj.a(this, "android.permission.SEND_SMS") == 0;
    }
```
