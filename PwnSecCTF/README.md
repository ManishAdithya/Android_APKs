Just an ez mobile chall for n00bies.
Great job, Mark! You encrypted the files, inserted them into the mobile application, and then forgot how to decrypt them. Seriously? Now, we have to figure out your mess. Well done! And by the way... YOU'RE FIRED!.
Descriptions are boring, just solve the challange meh!
Note: Make sure to run the mobile application on Android API 28 or less (Android 9 or less).
